# Nathaniel Buechler's Online Portfolio --- DEPRECATED
My new webpage live on http://www.nathanielbuechler.com. This project is the 7th iteration of my webpage. Displaying my 'hat' - or role - as a Multifacited Specialist, this project displays the qualities of a technician that masters many skills while being sometimes satisfactory at many more.

# History
The original project was made many years ago with Photoshop slices. If you're unfamiliar with that concept, it is when the web designer takes a photoshop file and slices it into HTML tables. While much different from the 1st iteration, the 7th iteration doesn't use a web framework. This deprecated project is more of an artifact ofmy website.

# Goals
* The main goal is to display all of my accomplishments.
* This project is meant to show both breadth and depth, and therfore shows elements of my history that are less than perfect.
* It is meant to show a whole picture of who I am, but it also focuses the viewer by provided different roles.

# Lessons Learned
* Using a web framework would have eliminated problems in creating repetitive code blocks. In version 8, I used angular.js (version 1)
* Due to lack of skill in some areas of my JavaScript at the time, I found that there are some rough spots where the code could be more elegant (looking back in 2016)
* I discovered that using an IDE like Brackets.io or Atom.io (even better) would have made developing this easier. Dreamweaver (part of Adobe) is nice for web designers, but large scale applications don't hold up - even with Dreamweaver's template functionality.
* Anyone can make a great user experience with a stylish user interface, even with a little bit of knowledge of d3.js, jQuery, etc.
* Static pages can build useful apps, but I should have used more JSON objects to serialize data back then (looking back in 2016)
