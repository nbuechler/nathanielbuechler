</p>
                        <p>Later I discovered in middle school art classes that my favorite classes were those that let me get my hands messy. My peers and I were given the opportunity to choose an extra elective and I chose to take another basic art course. I learned the fundamentals of making pottery, recycling newsprint into books, binding prints we made from etchings in the book, and of course how to store small paintings. I think that eighth grade fostered my love of art.

These were the build tools I first learned to deploy my Java and Groovy applications. But before I get to far ahead of myself, I want to discuss Python.
</p>
                        <p>While at UMBC (University of Maryland, Baltimore County), I found that programming could be very exciting, and I discovered Udacity where I first learned Python. I would be surprised to learn later the similarities between programming languages. I'm currently a Java developer in my profession, but I am learning Python to master my ability to build powerful scripts... but this chapter of my life is still being written!

                        <p>During my first year at UMBC, my interests had not lead me to Political Science. I decided to enroll in Political Science 260 â€“ the study of comparative politics: an introduction. Interestingly, I found that my knowledge of culture and people could be very useful, and I found that humanity actually has many more similarities than differences. Said simply, our collective means and ways of doing and being have produced the basic state.
</p>
                        <p>I found out that I enjoyed learning about how some of us in society can shape these states into powerful machines that do not discriminate between good and bad. In fact, my intrigue was and still is focused on the subjective nature of human relations. Moreover, I graduated with a Political Science degree from UMBC with an informal focus on institutional study.

To be perfectly honest, I never thought of myself as a programmer until many years after I started programming. But nevertheless, I have been using Object Oriented Programming principles since 2010 and those ideas have carried into my other thought processes in different fields.
</p>
                        <p>I find programming a liberating experiences, where an individual has an army of idiotic robots. If the programmer can be a great instructor, those robots become highly intelligent and merge into a single conscious being which becomes better at performing tasks. Essentially, the new being becomes smarter than the programmer.

I found out that I enjoyed learning about culture in high school because at Oakland Mills High School, the population is quite diverse. In my first year at UMBC, I learned that the university compels its students take courses in a variety of disciplines. So, I discovered that cultural anthropology would fulfill one of my basic academic requirements.
</p>
                        <p>I learned about a tribe that mourns their dead by cannibalizing the flesh of the dead. Burial in this custom is similar to western culture's view on cannibalizing the dead. Interestingly, the perspectives are reversed in the two aforementioned customs. Cultural relativism, since that class has intrigued me and continues to shape my own perspective on different belief systems that individuals and societies share.

Whereas peers and my mentors there were enlisted, I was still a student in my high school. I was able to develop a large graphic design project called Scorpion Success.
</p>
                        <p>This project defined my skill set as print designer, and I published Scorpion Success as a book the following year. The content encompassed interviews, photography, and graphics I created and compiled for my high school. The book served as a success guide for students. But, my favorite part of the entire experience was understanding and receiving the appreciation of parents and students that replied to me with outstanding reviews. They loved the assistance I provided, and that part of my history continues to motivate me in creating great products.

                        <p>My journalism background started in the beginning of my adult life as high school senior. I found that I enjoyed learning about events and reporting them to those around me. Later, I continued as a contributing writer at UMBC. I've covered topics ranging from health care, political issues, to economic problems in society. My focus is more passionately centered around local issues.
</p>
                        <p>I believe the largest impact can be made if we can convince those around us to become more active citizens. I started a blog after I finished writing for the university paper, and targeted that blog at the UMBC community. Due to some of the roles I had in student organizations, I was able to discuss topics that university students find important such as student fees, sports discussions, and student government.

Throughout my childhood schooling, I was always interested in music, and I think that had a part to play in my role as first chair trumpet through most of my concert and marching band positions. I think I was defined to a great extent by the numerous solos that I've had. I remember standing on the field of my high school football field during the half time show.
</p>
                        <p>I had covered my trumpet in black and orange paint to show my personal spirit. Sweat dripping from my nose, I held the trumpet mouthpiece to my lips and started one of the most powerful experiences I have had. The sound carried to the entire audience and the crowd cheered. As I returned back into the formation of the entire marching band, I realized that I had just demonstrated the synchronicity that I think every human calls community.

I studied organic chemistry, biology, genetics, and more!
</p>
                        <p>But the real take-away from the experience is the knowledge I have of exciting developments with carbon nanotubes and nanotechnologies. The implication that one day soon humanity will be able to replicate its desires at a whim is unbelievably cool! I wont say any more on this topic only because I am still developing a more comprehensive understanding of this new frontier.

I enjoyed using the paint to create impressionism works and I discovered that while French society may have deemed this work to be fake art, and the Nazi regime called it degenerate, the demand for photo-realism has not wavered in the United States. My high school instructors were encouraging, but I did not receive any awards.
</p>
                        <p>I quickly noticed that recognition on a county level was â€“ at least a the time â€“ given to those who conformed their artistic style to the standards at play. The happy ending to this story is a good one, because I now have a great hobby. At the time, this blessing in disguise gave me opportunity to hone other interests.

I enjoy creating panoramas because I know that humans don't really notice the curvature of the Earth, and I think that the camera really does. Also, photos that require longer shutter exposures are always addictive and challenging for me because I like the puzzle of balancing f-stop and shutter speed.
</p>
                        <p>An idea for exploration is creating mixed media pieces combining multiple photographs with other fine art mediums. I haven't had the opportunity to take this direction completely, but I have a large stock of photos that I plan on sharing and making open under the GPLv3 license. I think it would be pretty beneficial if more artists and photographers collaborated, so I want to do my part, too!

                        <p>Quite a few of my university instructors gave me the freedom to explore controversial ideas, and I was able to determine the beneficial and detrimental aspects of the current economic system. If we all understand the economy has an etymological root to the idea of household management, then we should also understand that changes ought to be made if our household is not in order.
</p>
                        <p>I determined that some of the failures in our markets are caused by major problems of asymmetric information in our securities exchanges. And I picked this topic as a study due to a research grant I received as an undergraduate student at UMBC. I studied the two economic structures of Germany and the United States, and more specifically, what caused AIG to fail in the United States and what allowed Allianz in Germany to survive.
